Simple and specific to this question

* Topological sort
https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1078072/introduction-to-topological-sort

We are still doing cycle detection.

* Indegree counting
https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/discuss/1278413/Python-Indegree-counting-97-fast-95-memory-12-lines

The crux of cycle detection with topological sort.
